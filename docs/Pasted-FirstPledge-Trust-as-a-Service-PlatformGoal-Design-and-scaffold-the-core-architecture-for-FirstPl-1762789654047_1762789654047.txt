FirstPledge - Trust-as-a-Service PlatformGoal: Design and scaffold the core architecture for FirstPledge, a "Trust-as-a-Service" platform for vetting consumer products. The output must prioritize scalable, modular architecture and a premium, authoritative user experience (UX/UI), drawing inspiration from platforms known for exceptional design and clarity, such as Cred, Apple products, and modern health-tech apps (like Yuka).1. Core Architectural Mandates (Scalability & Modularity)The system must be designed for future growth. Emphasize separation of concerns (e.g., microservices approach if applicable to Replit's environment) and clear API boundaries.API-First Approach: The backend logic (Vetting Engine, Data Storage) must be exposed via clean, secure, and predictable APIs, separate from the frontend.Decoupled Data Storage: Define clear data models for Product Reports and the Master Ingredient Memory. Recommend a robust, scalable persistence layer suitable for a Replit environment (e.g., PostgreSQL or a strong NoSQL alternative if performance is key).Modular Vetting Engine: Design the AI Vetting Engine logic as a standalone service with distinct, replaceable modules for:Text Parsing (Raw ingredient list $\rightarrow$ Structured list)Memory Check (Ingredient name $\rightarrow$ Master List lookup)External Research (API calls using GOOGLE_API_KEY/GOOGLE_CX_ID)Analysis & Citation (Generative AI processing using GEMINI_API_KEY)2. Premium UX/UI Design & Frontend DirectivesThe public interface (Consumer Flow B) must convey instant trust and authority through a minimalist, clean, and interactive design."Apple/Cred-like" Aesthetics: Use high-contrast, clean typography (e.g., a strong Sans-serif font), generous whitespace, and a focused color palette (Green, Yellow, Red for status, plus neutrals).Visual Trust Signals: Implement the Green Shield, Yellow Warning, and Red Ban iconography prominently and consistently across the Consumer flow.Sleek Interactivity: For the full Safety Report, implement "Cred-like" accordions for ingredient details (rationale + citation link). The design must feel fast, responsive, and avoid visual clutter.3. Key Feature Implementation FocusAdmin Dashboard (Flow A): Focus on speed and efficiency. The UI for editorial review must use highly interactive elements (e.g., click-to-toggle status buttons instead of slow dropdowns) for rapid human verification and override.Public Report Pages (Flow B): Ensure pages are SEO-ready (dynamic meta tags) and prominently feature the "Evidence" section to build trust.4. Technology Stack RecommendationRecommend a modern, performant, and maintainable stack suitable for a Replit environment that supports the architectural goals (e.g., React/Next.js/Vue.js for the frontend; Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express for the backend).5. Required Replit Secrets IntegrationThe architecture must securely integrate and utilize the following environment variables for the Vetting Engine:GOOGLE_API_KEYGOOGLE_CX_IDGEMINI_API_KEY
