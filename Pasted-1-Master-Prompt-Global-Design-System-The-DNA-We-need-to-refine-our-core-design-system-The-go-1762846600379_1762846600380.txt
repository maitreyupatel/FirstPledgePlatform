1. Master Prompt: Global Design System (The "DNA")
"We need to refine our core design system. The goal is 'articulate trust,' not 'generic tech.' It needs to feel less like a template and more like a bespoke, high-end instrument."

Refine Typography:

Font: The current font is thin and lacks presence. Implement Inter or Satoshi as the global font.

Hierarchy: Create a more articulate typographic scale. Headings (like "All-Purpose Cleaning Spray") must have more presence and authority (try a heavier weight, like 600 or 700). Body copy must be perfectly readable (size 16px, line-height 1.6).

Refine Color Palette:

Action Color: The current "Buy" green is too aggressive. We need a more sophisticated, "trustworthy" green. Let's call it brand-green-primary.

State Colors: The "Caution" yellow is jarring. We will replace it.

status-safe: A gentle, muted green (e.g., text-green-700 in a bg-green-50 pill).

status-caution: A premium, muted amber or orange (e.g., text-amber-700 in a bg-amber-50 pill). Not a harsh warning, but a thoughtful advisory.

status-banned: A deep, serious, muted red.

Refine Iconography:

The shield and caution triangle icons are generic. Replace them with a custom, pixel-perfect set. They must be line-art, slightly rounded, and feel like they belong to the FirstPledge brand.

2. Master Prompt: Homepage Redesign (The "First Impression")
"The Homepage Hero is our promise. It must be emotional, not clinical."

Rethink the Hero Image:

The "beakers" image (image bf047e.jpg) is a mistake. It says "cold lab," not "safety" or "care."

Replace it with an aspirational, emotional image that represents the outcome of trust. Think: A beautiful, soft-focus shot of natural, raw ingredients (like honey, oats, lavender). Or a macro shot of a single, perfect leaf. It must be organic and warm.

Refine the Hero Text:

"Trust Through Transparency" is strong. Keep it.

The subtext ("Instant, authoritative clarity...") is generic tech-speak. Simplify it.

New Subtext: "We analyze every ingredient, so you don't have to. Welcome to the FirstPledge standard." It's human.

Refine the Product Grid:

This is your best-looking component. It just needs refinement.

Add Whitespace: Increase the gap in the grid. Give the products "room to breathe."

Refine the Card: The "View Report" link is weak.

New Card Footer: Make the entire card clickable, but also add a "View Report" link with a clean right-arrow icon (→) for a clearer call to action.

3. Master Prompt: Product Page Redesign (The "Core Experience")
"This page is failing. It prioritizes the affiliate link over the trust report. We must reverse this. The report is the hero, not the button."

Re-architect the Page Layout:

The "Buy on Amazon" button is too high. It distracts from the report.

New Layout Order:

Product Image

Product Name & Brand

New: "Safety Meter" (see below)

Safety Summary

"Ingredient Evidence" (The List)

"Buy on Amazon" Button (Moved to the BOTTOM)

The "Buy" button is the consequence of earning their trust. It must come after we show our work.

Change the "Buy on Amazon" button to a secondary "ghost" style (e.g., border-green-primary text-green-primary) to be less aggressive.

Create a "Safety Meter" Component:

The "5 Safe, 3 Caution, 0 Banned" numbers are data, not information. They lack impact.

New Component: Create a "Safety Meter." This should be a horizontal, segmented bar graph.

Example: A bar [ Safe (5) | Caution (3) | Banned (0) ] with colors. It's an instant visual summary of the product's DNA.

Refine the "Ingredient Evidence" Accordion:

This is the core of our IP. It must feel premium.

Add Padding: Add generous padding inside each accordion item.

Refine the States: Replace the generic yellow "Caution" tag with our new status-caution pill (the muted amber).

Improve Typography: The "SOURCE" link is too small. Make it a clear, clickable link: "View Research Citation ↗".

Add Interaction: When an item is expanded, it should have a subtle background color change to show it's "active."
