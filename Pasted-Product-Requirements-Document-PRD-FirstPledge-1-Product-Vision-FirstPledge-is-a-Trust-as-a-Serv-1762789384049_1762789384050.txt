Product Requirements Document (PRD): FirstPledge
1. Product Vision
FirstPledge is a "Trust-as-a-Service" platform that vets general consumer products (skincare, food, cleaning supplies). It uses an AI-powered research engine to analyze ingredient lists against recognized safety standards, enabling a human "Editor-in-Chief" to rapidly review and publish trusted, evidence-backed Safety Reports for the public.

Core Value Proposition
For Consumers: Instant, authoritative clarity on product safety, backed by transparent, clickable evidence (citations).

For the Admin: A 10x faster research workflow. The AI acts as a junior researcher, proposing complete reports in seconds for final human approval.

2. Core User Flows
Flow A: The Admin (Editor-in-Chief)
Input: Admin accesses a private dashboard and provides product details (Name, Brand, Image URL, Affiliate Link) and a raw, unformatted list of ingredients.

AI Research: Admin initiates the "Vetting Engine." The system autonomously researches every ingredient, determining its safety status and finding a credible source citation.

Editorial Review: Admin reviews the AI-generated "Proposed Report." They can manually override any rating, edit the summary for tone, or add missing details.

Publish: Admin approves the report, making it instantly live for public viewing.

Flow B: The Consumer (Public User)
Discovery: User lands on a visually clean homepage showing a grid of recently vetted products with clear "Safe/Caution" badges.

Verification: User clicks a product to view the full Safety Report.

Trust Building: User explores the "Evidence" section—an interactive list where they can expand any ingredient to see why it received its rating and click the link to the original research source.

Action: User clicks a prominent "Buy on Amazon" button to purchase the vetted product.

3. Key Functional Requirements
3.1 AI Vetting Engine (The Core IP)
The system needs an autonomous "Research Agent" that can:

Parse raw, messy ingredient text into a structured list.

Check Memory: Recognize if an ingredient has been vetted before to avoid re-researching it.

Perform Research: If an ingredient is new, use external search tools to find credible safety information (e.g., toxicity reports, regulatory databases).

Analyze & Cite: Use generative AI to read search results, assign a rating (Safe, Caution, Banned), write a one-sentence rationale, and provide a source URL.

3.2 Admin Dashboard
A private interface optimized for speed and editorial control:

Simple data entry forms for new products.

Interactive Proposal View: A UI that displays the AI's findings in an editable format before publishing. Toggles for status (Green/Yellow/Red) are preferred over dropdowns for speed.

3.3 Public Experience (UX/UI)
The public interface must feel premium and authoritative (similar to fintech or health-tech apps like Cred or Yuka):

Visual Trust Signals: Use clear color-coding (Green Shield, Yellow Warning, Red Ban) universally.

"Cred-like" Accordions: Ingredient details (rationale + citation) should be hidden behind a smooth expand/collapse interaction to keep the page clean but information-dense when needed.

SEO Ready: All public product pages must have dynamic meta-titles and descriptions based on their unique content.

4. Data Concepts (The "Truth")
The system requires a persistent way to store two core types of data. The exact implementation (database vs. files) is flexible, provided it is robust and suitable for the Replit environment.

Ingredient Memory: A "Master List" of every ingredient ever vetted, storing its name, assigned status, AI summary, and citation. This is our growing intellectual property.

Product Reports: The final, published reports containing product metadata and the list of its specific ingredients (linked to the Ingredient Memory).

5. External Toolkit (Replit Secrets)
The Replit Agent should use these environment secrets to power the AI Vetting Engine:

GOOGLE_API_KEY: For accessing Google's suite of AI and Search tools.

GOOGLE_CX_ID: For using the Programmable Search Engine to find safety reports.

GEMINI_API_KEY: For accessing the Generative AI model to analyze search results (if distinct from the general Google key).
